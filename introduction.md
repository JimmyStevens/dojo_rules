Introduction

I am Jimmy Stevens. I am a 6 foot white male
 with heterzygous phenotypes. Through grit and
 determination I hold a software engineer
 position without the experience but I am
 learning on the fly and love it. 

My favorite Code School path is JavaScript. I
think that since this is my first, I cannot
reasonably comment on 'my favorite'.
